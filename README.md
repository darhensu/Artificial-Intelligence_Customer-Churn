# Artificial Intelligence - Customer Churn
Rapid market growth in every sector is leading to a larger customer base for more competitive service providers with new and innovative business models, as well as better services increasing customer acquisition costs. Customer churn is a customer's tendency to leave a service or company. Here we use one method that can be used, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN). ANN is an artificial neural network technique that manages information inspired by the workings of the biological nervous system, especially information processing in human brain cells. The results obtained with a classification accuracy of up to 90%. This research was successful and suitable to be applied in this method because it is seen from its high level of accuracy.

Unlock the potential of Artificial Intelligence with our groundbreaking project: 'Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model.' In this endeavor, we harness the capabilities of cutting-edge technology to predict and mitigate customer churn in businesses. Our innovative approach leverages the power of Artificial Neural Networks, providing a sophisticated model that learns and adapts to intricate patterns in customer behavior. By delving into the realms of predictive analytics, we aim to empower businesses with actionable insights, allowing them to proactively retain valuable customers and optimize their strategies. Join us on the forefront of AI-driven solutions as we redefine customer retention through the lens of advanced neural network models.
